TODO file for Workflow

$Id$

- Implement handling of forgotten filename parameter to parse in
  Workflow::Config::Perl, this might have to propagate to Workflow::Config::XML
  also

- Add support for string based configuration instead of file based (copying
  behavior from XML::Simple) ?

- Investigate failings tests in t/persister_dbi.t, this has only observed twice
  and does not seem to be consistent. Perhaps this is related to execution time
  for the test suite and the use of now.

- Write more POD, including a tutorial

- Write more tests

- Deal with whatever is in the RT queue

- Examine and apply received patches

From TODO.txt:

- Where to put the configuration for the built-in
validators/conditions/actions? Should we make it part of the
WorkflowFactory initialization process, maybe just keep the built-ins
configured in a class that's distributed with the module? (We don't
want to force people to reference a separate file every time...

- Make the action/description of initial history created configurable
(optional?)
