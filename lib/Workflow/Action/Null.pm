=head1 NAME

Workflow::Action::Null - Workflow action for the terminally lazy

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.59 of this package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # in workflow.xml...
 <state name="some state">
   <action name="null" />
   ...

 # in workflow_action.xml...
 <action name="null" class="Workflow::Action::Null" />

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Workflow action that does nothing. But unlike all those other lazy
modules out there, it does nothing with a purpose! For instance, you
might want some poor slobs to have some action verified but the elite
masters can skip the work entirely. So you can do:

  <state name="checking" autorun="yes">
     <action name="verify" resulting_state="verified">
         <condition name="isPoorSlob" />
     </action>
     <action name="null" resulting_state="verified">
         <condition name="isEliteMaster" />
     </action>
  </state>

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

=head3 execute()

Implemented from L<Workflow::Action>. Proudly does nothing and proves
it by returning C<undef>.
