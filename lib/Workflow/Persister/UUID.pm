=head1 NAME

Workflow::Persister::UUID - Persister to generate Universally Unique Identifiers

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.56 of this package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 <persister
     name="MyPersister"
     use_uuid="yes"
 ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implementation for any persister to generate a UUID/GUID ID
string. The resulting string is 36 characters long and, according to
the implementation docs, "is guaranteed to be different from all other
UUIDs/GUIDs generated until 3400 CE."

This uses the L<Data::UUID> module to generate the UUID string, so
look there if you are curious about the algorithm, efficiency, etc.

=head2 METHODS

=head3 new

Instantiates a Workflow::Persister::UUID object, which is actually an
encapsulation of L<Data::UUID>.

=head3 pre_fetch_id

L</pre_fetch_id> can then be used to generate/retrieve a unique ID, generated
by L<Data::UUID>.

=head3 post_fetch_id

This method is unimplemented at this time, please see the TODO.
