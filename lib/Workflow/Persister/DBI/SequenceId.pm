=head1 NAME

Workflow::Persister::DBI::SequenceId - Persister to fetch ID from a sequence

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.56 of this package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 <persister
     name="MyPersister"
     workflow_sequence="wf_seq"
     history_sequence="wf_history_seq"
 ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Implementation for DBI persister to fetch an ID value from a sequence.

=head2 Properties

B<sequence_name>

Name of the sequence to select the next id value from.

B<sequence_select>

C<sprintf> template string with a single placeholder (C<%s>) used to
interpolate the sequence name. The resulting string is used as the SQL
statement to retrieve the next sequence value.

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 log

Contains the logger object associated with this instance.

=head2 METHODS

=head3 new ( \%params )

This method instantiates a class for retrieval of sequence ids from a
L<DBI> based persistance entity.

It takes a hashref containing keys matching the properties outlines in the
section above or throws L<Workflow::Exception>s if these are not defined.

Returns instantiated object upon success.

=head3 pre_fetch_id

Returns a unique sequence id from a database.

Takes a single parameter, a L<DBI> database handle.

Returns a single value, a integer representing a sequence id from the provided
database handle.

=head3 post_fetch_id

This is a I<dummy> method, use L</pre_fetch_id>
