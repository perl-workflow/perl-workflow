=head1 NAME

Workflow::Persister::File - Persist workflow and history to the filesystem

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.59 of this package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 <persister name="MainPersister"
            class="Workflow::Persister::File"
            path="/home/workflow/storage"/>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Main persistence class for storing the workflow and workflow history
records to a filesystem for later retrieval. Data are stored in
serialized Perl data structure files.

=head2 METHODS

=head3 constitute_object

This method deserializes an object.

Takes a single parameter of an filesystem path pointing to an object

Returns the re-instantiated object or dies.

=head3 create_history

Serializes history records associated with a workflow object

Takes two parameters: a workflow object and an array of workflow history objects

Returns: provided array of workflow history objects upon success

=head3 create_workflow

Serializes a workflow into the persistance entity configured by our workflow.

Takes a single parameter: a workflow object

Returns a single value, a id for unique identification of out serialized
workflow for possible deserialization.

=head3 fetch_history

Deserializes history records associated with a workflow object

Takes a single parameter: a workflow object

Returns an array of workflow history objects upon success

=head3 fetch_workflow

Deserializes a workflow from the persistance entity configured by our workflow.

Takes a single parameter: the unique id assigned to our workflow upon
serialization (see L</create_workflow>).

Returns a hashref consisting of two keys:

=over

=item * state, the workflows current state

=item * last_update, date indicating last update

=back

=head3 init ( \%params )

Method to initialize the persister object. Sets up the configured generators

Throws a L<Workflow::Exception> if a valid filesystem path is not provided with
the parameters.

=head3 serialize_object

Method that writes a given object to a given path.

Takes two parameters: path (a filesystem path) and an object

Throws L<Workflow::Exception> if unable to serialize the given object to the
given path.

Returns: Nothing

=head3 update_workflow

Updates a serialized workflow in the persistance entity configured by our
workflow.

Takes a single parameter: a workflow object

Returns: Nothing

=head1 TODO

=over

=item * refactor L</constitute_object>, no checks are made on filesystem prior
to deserialization attempt.

=back
