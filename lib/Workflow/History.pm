=head1 NAME

Workflow::History - Recorded work on a workflow action or workflow itself

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 1.59 of this package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # in your action
 sub execute {
     my ( $self, $wf ) = @_;
     my $current_user = $wf->context->param( 'current_user' );
     # ... do your work with $ticket
     $wf->add_history( action => 'create ticket',
                       user   => $current_user->full_name,
                       description => "Ticket $ticket->{subject} successfully created" );
 }

 # in your view (using TT2)
 [% FOREACH history = workflow.get_history %]
    On:     [% OI.format_date( history.date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' ) %]<br>
    Action: [% history.action %] (ID: [% history.id %])<br>
    by:     [% history.user %]<br>
    [% history.description %]
 [% END %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Every workflow can record its history. More appropriately, every
action the workflow executes can deposit history entries in the
workflow to be saved later. Neither the action nor the workflow knows
about how the history is saved, just that the history is available.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Public Methods

=head3 new( \%params )

Create a new history object, filling it with properties from
C<\%params>.

=head3 set_new_state( $new_state )

Assigns the new state C<$new_state> to the history if the state is not
already assigned. This is used when you generate a history request in
a L<Workflow::Action> since the workflow state will change once the
action has successfully completed. So in the action you create a
history object without the state:

  $wf->add_history(
      Workflow::History->new({
          action      => "Cocoa Puffs",
          description => "They're magically delicious",
          user        => "Count Chocula",
      })
  );

And then after the new state has been set but before the history
objects are stored the workflow sets the new state in all unsaved
history objects.

=head3 is_saved()

Returns true (1) if this history object has been saved, false (0) if not.
