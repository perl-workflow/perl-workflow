=head1 NAME

Workflow::Persister - Base class for workflow persistence

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 2.03 of this package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Associate a workflow with a persister
 <workflow type="Ticket"
           persister="MainDatabase">
 ...

 # Declare a persister
 <persister name="MainDatabase"
            class="Workflow::Persister::DBI"
            driver="MySQL"
            dsn="DBI:mysql:database=workflows"
            user="wf"
            password="mypass"/>

 # Declare a separate persister
 <persister name="FileSystem"
            class="Workflow::Persister::File"
            path="/path/to/my/workflow"/>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for persisting workflows. It does not implement
anything itself but actual implementations should subclass it to
ensure they fulfill the contract.

The job of a persister is to create, update and fetch the workflow
object plus any data associated with the workflow. It also creates and
fetches workflow history records.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

=head2 Methods

=head3 create_workflow( $workflow )

Stub that warns that the method should be overwritten in the derived
Persister. Since this is a SUPER class.

Generate an ID for the workflow, serialize the workflow data (ID and
state) and set the ID in the workflow.

Returns the ID for the workflow.

=head3 update_workflow( $workflow )

Stub that warns that the method should be overwritten in the derived
Persister. Since this is a SUPER class.

Update the workflow state including serialization of the workflow
context.

Returns nothing.

=head3 fetch_workflow( $workflow_id )

Stub that warns that the method should be overwritten in the derived
Persister. Since this is a SUPER class.

Retrieve the workflow data corresponding to C<$workflow_id>. It not
found return undef, if found return a hashref with at least the keys
C<state> and C<last_update> (a L<DateTime> instance).

If the workflow has associated serialized context, return the
deserialized hash value in the C<context> key.  The keys in the hash
will be made available through the C<param> method in the workflow's
context (accessible through the C<context> method).

=head3 create_history( $workflow, @history )

Stub that warns that the method should be overwritten in the derived
Persister. Since this is a SUPER class.

Serialize all objects in C<@history> for later retrieval.

Returns C<@history>, the list of history objects, with the history
C<id> and C<saved> values set according to the saved results.

=head3 fetch_history( $workflow )

Stub that warns that the method should be overwritten in the derived
Persister. Since this is a SUPER class.

The derived class method should return a list of hashes containing at least
the `id` key. The hashes will be used by the workflow object to instantiate
L<Workflow::History> objects (or a derived class).


=head3 assign_generators( \%params )

Assigns proper generators based on intialization, see L</init>

=head3 commit_transaction

Commit the current transaction if the persister supports transactions.
This stub does not have to be overridden. It is not executed if
autocommit is on.

=head3 rollback_transaction

Roll back the current transaction if the persister supports transactions.
This stub does not have to be overridden. It is not executed if
autocommit is on.

=head3 init

Method to initialize persister based on configuration.

=head3 init_random_generators( \%params )

Initializes random id generators, takes the following named parameters:

=over

=item * length, of random id to be generated

=back

Returns two identical random id generator objects in list context.

=head3 init_uuid_generators( \%params )

Initializes UUID generators, takes no parameters

Returns two identical UUID generator objects in list context.

=head1 TODO

=over

=item * refactor init_random_generators, returns two similar objects?

=item * refactor init_uuid_generators, returns two similar objects?

=item * refactor init_uuid_generators, takes no parameters, even though
we shift parameters in?
